    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a program similar to this unit's End-To-End Example. Instead of European countries this program will provide a drop-down of US states. When a state is selected, the program should display the US senators for that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "What information Should you display? Here is a sample of the 2 senators from the State of `NY`:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sen. Charles “Chuck” Schumer [D-NY]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Senior Senator for New York\n",
    "    PARTY: Democrat\n",
    "    PHONE: 202-224-6542\n",
    "    WEBSITE: https://www.schumer.senate.gov\n",
    "    CONTACT: https://www.schumer.senate.gov/contact/email-chuck\n",
    "    \n",
    " ## Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand [D-NY]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Junior Senator for New York\n",
    "    PARTY: Democrat\n",
    "    PHONE: 202-224-4451\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HINTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything you will display for a senator can be found in the dictionary for that senator. Look at the keys available for a single senator as reference.\n",
    "- You will need to make a list of unqiue states from the senators.json file, similar to how to approaches the problem in last week's homework for product categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This Code will fetch the current US Senators from the web and save the results to a `US-Senators.json` file."

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",
