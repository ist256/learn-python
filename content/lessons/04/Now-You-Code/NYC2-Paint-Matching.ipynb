    "The price of paint is determined by the following factors:\n",
    "- Everyday quality paint is `$19.99` per gallon.\n",
    "- Select quality paint is `$24.99` per gallon.\n",
    "- Premium quality paint is `$32.99` per gallon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition if the customer wants computerized color-matching that incurs an additional fee of `$4.99` per gallon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to ask the user to select a paint quality: 'everyday', 'select' or 'premium' and then whether they need color matching and then outputs the price per gallon of the paint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Run 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which paint quality do you require ['everyday', 'select', 'premium'] ?select\n",
    "Do you require color matching [y/n] ?y\n",
