    "We call `i <=3` the loop's **exit condition**. The variable `i` inside the exit condition is the only thing that we can change to make the exit condition `False`, therefore it is the **loop control variable**. On line 4 we change the loop control variable by adding one to it, this is called an **increment**.\n",

    "Furthermore, we know how many times this loop will execute before it actually runs: 3. Even if we allowed the user to enter a number, and looped that many times, we would still know.
