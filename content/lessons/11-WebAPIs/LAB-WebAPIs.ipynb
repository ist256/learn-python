    "# Class Coding Lab: Web Services and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The web has long evolved from user-consumption to device consumption. In the early days of the web when you wanted to check the weather, you opened up your browser and visited a website. Nowadays your smart watch / smart phone retrieves the weather for you and displays it on the device. Your device can't predict the weather. It's simply consuming a weather based service. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key to making device consumption work are API's (Application Program Interfaces). Products we use everyday like smartphones, Amazon's Alexa, and gaming consoles all rely on API's. They seem \"smart\" and \"powerful\" but in actuality they're only interfacing with smart and powerful services in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "API consumption is the new reality of programming; it is why we cover it in this course. Once you undersand how to conusme API's you can write a program to do almost anything and harness the power of the internet to make your own programs look \"smart\" and \"powerful.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will be a walk-through for how to use a Web API. Specifically we will use the Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API to features like sentiment and entity recognition to our programs.\n"
