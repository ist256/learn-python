    "# Now You Code In Class: Gathering Data and Reporting Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "For this in-class exercise we demonstrate a common programming pattern for reporting statistics on data in real time as it is input. This is used for data collection and real time analyics of time-series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will input temperatures ourselves, but same code could be used to read from an actual temperature sensor or any other type of sensor or data stream for that matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to input a series of temperatures in Celcius, until `quit` is entered (sentinel controlled indefinite loop). For each temperature input, we should output:\n",
    "\n",
    " - the count of temperatures recorded\n",
    " - the mean (average) temperature recorded\n",
    " - the max temperature recorded\n",
    " - the min temperature recorded\n",
    " - the count and percentage of temperatures above freezing\n",
    " - the count and percentage of temperatures at or below freezing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Run:\n",

    "    Enter temp: 100\n",

Typically we use problem simplification to constrain the inputs, but since this problem has only one input, instead we will constrain the outputs. \n",
