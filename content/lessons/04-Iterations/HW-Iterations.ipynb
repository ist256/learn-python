    "Professor Charles Xavier is at it again. He would like you to improve on the program you wrote for him last week. As you may recall this program, when given an input of a student points earned in the course, would output a letter grade and grade points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prof. Xavier would like the program to input multiple points earned as part of a sentinel controlled loop, and as each student total point score is entered calculate the following statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- count of student point scores in \"A\" range, and percentage of total\n",
    "- count of student point scores in \"B\" range, and percentage of total\n",
    "- count of student point scores in \"C\" range, and percentage of total\n",
    "- count of student point scores in \"D\" range, and percentage of total\n",
    "- count of student point scores in \"F\" range, and percentage of total\n",
