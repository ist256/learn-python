    "# Now You Code 4: Reddit News Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you're tasked with performing a sentiment analysis on top Reddit news articles. (`https://www.reddit.com/r/news/top.json`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should perform the analysis on the titles only. \n",
    "\n",
    "Start by getting the Reddit API to work, and extracting a list of titles only. You'll have to research the Reddit API, and can do so here: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/ The Reddit API requires a custom 'User-Agent' You must specify this in your headers, as explained here: https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After you get Reddit working move on to sentiment analysis. Once again, we will use (`http://text-processing.com/api/sentiment/`) like we did in the in-class coding lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by writing the `GetRedditStories` and `GetSentiment` functions, then putting it all together."
