    "Let's write a basic sentiment analyzer in Python. Sentiment analysis is the act of extracting mood from text. It has practical applications in analyzing reactions in social media, product opinions, movie reviews and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1.0 version of our sentiment analyzer will start with a string of positive and negative words. For any input text and the sentiment score will be calculated by simply adding up the frequency of the positive words, then subtracting out the negative words.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    positive_text = \"happy glad like\"\n",
    "    negative_text = \"angry mad hate\"\n",

    "    score = -1 [ +1 for like, -1 for angry, -1 for mad]\n",
    "```\n",

Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better?
