    "In this assignment you're tasked with performing a sentiment analysis on top Reddit news articles. (`https://www.reddit.com/r/news/top.json`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should perform the analysis on the titles only. \n",
    "\n",
    "Start by getting the Reddit API to work, and extracting a list of titles only. You'll have to research the Reddit API, and can do so here: https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/ The Reddit API requires a custom 'User-Agent' You must specify this in your headers, as explained here: https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API \n",

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",
