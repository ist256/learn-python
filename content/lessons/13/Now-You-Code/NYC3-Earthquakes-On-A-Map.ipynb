    "- Then plot it on a folium map using CircleMarkers (no need to use Pandas). \n",
    "- Make the size of the marker correlate to the magnitude of the earthquake (bigger circle for bigger magnitude) also when you click on the marker you should see the title of the earthquake.\n",

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",
